My name is Kymani (or Ky for short). My pronouns are he/they.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: kymani.baxter@uconn.edu ðŸ“«

Iâ€™m currently a physics major with a math minor ðŸ¤“ with an interest in exploring computational physics and quantum computing.

Iâ€™m currently learning how to conduct numerical computations in field theory! 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research projects that involve computational simulations or quantum computing models among other things! I also have an interest in economics, computer science, and data analysis.

Tools:
VSCode, Python, Github, Mathematica, Julia, LaTeX, 

âš¡ Fun fact: I am learning how to play guitar. I've been inspired by "rock" artists like Nirvana, Beabadoobee, and the pillows.
